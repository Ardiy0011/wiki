# Django

* Django is a web framework written using [Python](/wiki/Python) that allows for the design of web applications that generate [HTML](/wiki/HTML) dynamically.

* It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an American independent organization established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

* Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites.

* The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself. Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.
